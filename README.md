# Space Invaders
Based on original Space Invaders arcade game.

## How to Play:
1. Use the left and right arrows to move the laser cannon left and right across the screen. </br>
2. Use the space button to fire the laser at the invaders. Only one laser can be fired a time. </br> 
3. There are 3 types of alien invaders which are worth 10, 20, and 30 points respectively. They drop missiles as they move across the screen. If a missile hits your laser cannon, you lose a life. You have 3 lives in the game. </br> 
4. At some point in the game, a mystery ship will appear on the screen that is worth a significant amount of points. It will only cross the screen one time.
5. The game will end if the invaders reach the level of your cannon. </br>

Good luck!
